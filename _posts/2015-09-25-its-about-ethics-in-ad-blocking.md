title: It's about ethics in ad blocking
---

LOL.

The internet is tearing itself apart over ad blocking in iOS9, with ad proponents and publishers firing a volley of ethical criticisms at users and infosec pros and privacy advocates countering with the negative consequences of bad advertising.

To be specific the anti-blocking camp points out that online publishing is notoriously difficult to monetize, and content producers desire compensation for their work through what they view as a neutral medium with no consequences for their readers.

But in practical terms advertising is absolutely not consequence free. Modern oline advertising requires the collection of massive amounts of data that can be used to predict user behaviour in ways the user may not even be aware of. The data is also poorly guarded & even if you trust the ad networks and feel it's moral for them to be near-omniscient in your life, hackers and the NSA may convince you that perhaps we shouldn't be leaving this sort of data online if we can avoid it. Has an ad network sold your browsing history to a health insurer yet? Possibly not. Could they, and could it have real consequences to your health and financial situation? Absolutely.

Privacy concerns aside, ads have also been implicated a number of times as malware distribution. They measurably decrease computer performance. They use up the majority of the (especially on mobile, limited) bandwidth to download a site. They aren't simply harmless additions to content, they have real implications to your machine.

Am I as a reader committing an unethical act by not paying attention to your ad? By not clicking it? Why should it be unethical for me to block it via software vs. via a post-it note on my screen or by "un-seeing" it mentally?

And to circle back the ethical argument, data driven marketing is applied psychology. It's entire purpose is to manipulate people in to doing something they would not otherwise do. Is that ethical? I would argue it is not, or at the very least that it's less ethical than blocking the manipulation.
